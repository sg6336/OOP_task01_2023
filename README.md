ANAGRAM

Create a console application for reverse each word* in the input line

EXAMPLE:

"abcd efgh" => "dcba hgfe"; "Test" => "tseT"

All non-alphabetic symbols should stay in their original places.

EXAMPLES:

"a1bcd efg!h" => "d1cba hgf!e"

Space is the divider for words in a line.
Spaces (as one of non alphabetic symbols) should not be deleted from the result string.
