### Anagram

Create a console application for reverse each word* in the input line

Example:

``"abcd efgh" => "dcba hgfe"``\
``"Test" => "tseT"``

All non-alphabetic symbols should stay in their original places.

Examples:

``"a1bcd efg!h" => "d1cba hgf!e"``

Space is the divider for words in a line.\
Spaces (as one of non alphabetic symbols) should not be deleted from the result string.
